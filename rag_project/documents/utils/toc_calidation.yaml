task: validate_table_of_contents_with_images
output_format: json_list
output_instructions:
  - Only return the cleaned Table of Contents as a list of dictionaries.
  - Compare the provided structured TOC against the TOC extracted from the images.
  - Use the images to detect and confirm the correct structure and ordering of the TOC.
  - If the structured TOC is correct, clean it as necessary (e.g., remove duplicates).
  - If the structured TOC is incomplete or inconsistent with the image TOC, correct it using the image.
  - Do not include any explanatory text, comments, or headings.

rules:
  - Remove duplicated entries even if they have different levels.
  - Consider headers duplicated if their text is nearly identical.
  - Ensure ordering and page numbers are preserved.
  - Do not generate new headers unless absolutely necessary.
